    <h2>How to Prepare Country Ham</h2>
    <p> This is an <em>Easter period</em> favorite made with love.</p>
    <p>It comes with a rich taste of pork and peaches.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (3 pound) boneless ham</li>
        <li>¾ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup peach preserves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons prepared mustard</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to prepare</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a roasting pan with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Set ham into the prepared roasting pan and pierce several times with a fork.</li>
        <li>Stir brown sugar, peach preserves, and mustard together in a bowl; spread over ham. Cover ham with a sheet of aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Roast ham in preheated oven, basting regularly, for 90 minutes. Remove the aluminum foil cover and continue baking until hot in the center, 30 to 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).</li>
