    <h3>Steps to prepare</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To bloom saffron, sprinkle saffron over a few
            ice cubes in a small bowl; let stand at room temperature until ice melts
            completely, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon salt and return to a boil. Add rice; return to a boil and cook until rice is al dente, about 4 minutes. Drain rice and transfer to a large bowl. Dry pot.</li>
        <li>Stir chopped parsley, chives, dill, cilantro, cumin, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt into rice.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in pot over medium heat. Sprinkle sesame seeds and turmeric over oil. Top with tortilla then rice mixture. Remove any loose, papery outer layers from garlic bulbs; nestle bulbs into rice mixture. Poke five holes in rice using the handle of a wooden spoon to allow steam to escape.</li>
        <li>Cover pot with a clean kitchen towel, then cover the pot with a lid. Cook, covered, over medium heat until steam starts escaping, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix ghee into bloomed saffron in small bowl; pour mixture over rice. Reduce heat to low. Cook, covered, until rice is tender and garlic is softened, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove garlic; let cool until easy to handle, then peel each clove. Put serving platter upside down over pot and carefully invert rice onto platter. The tortilla tahdig will be on top.</li>
